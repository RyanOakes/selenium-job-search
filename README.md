###Job Searching With Selenium

***

####Synopsis

This is a simple Python script I wrote to learn some Selenium WebDriver
fundamentals. The program is straightforward - it asks a user to select which 
job search engine they wish to use, the search parameters they desire (e.g.
"python developer"), and the zip code of where they wish to search. After
that, a browser object is created and Selenium WebDriver does the rest!
